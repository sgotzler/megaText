1236, Captain Video and His Video Rangers. ,Series, Science Fiction, DuMont,,,1949,,,1957," On June 27, 1949, a daily series called Captain Video premiered in New York City on the DuMont network's flagship station, WABD-TV, channel 5. It was simply a showcase for old western theatrical films with Captain Video serving as the host. As the network began to grow, the format was changed to focus on a crime fighter known as ""The Guardian of the Safety of the World."" The Captain was given an assistant, the Video Ranger and the program opened with these words over Wagner's ""Flying Dutchman Overture"": ""Master of Space! Hero of Science! Captain of the Video Rangers! Operating from his secret mountain headquarters on the planet Earth, Captain Video rallies men of goodwill everywhere. As he rockets from planet to planet, let us follow the champion of truth, justice and freedom throughout the universe. Stand by for Captain Video and His Video Rangers."" Only a handful of Captain Video episodes appear to exist; press release information is very scarce; and the pre-national TV Guide, TV Forecast, is extremely sketchy. It is difficult to determine when in 1949 the new Captain Video format emerged and when the words ""and His Video Rangers"" were added to the title. At this time, and until 1951, Jack Orsen played the Captain's superior, Commissioner Bell. In 1951 (and until 1957) Al Hodge took over the role of Captain Video (from Richard Coogan); Ben Lackland became Commission Carey, the Captain's new superior, from 1951 until 1955. The evil Dr. Pauli also became a regular at this time. Hoping to cash in on the show's popularity, DuMont added a Saturday morning version of the series called The Secret Files of Captain Video (9/5/53-5/29/54). Although that original DuMont station is still broadcasting in New York (now WNYW) it has no records of its time as a DuMont station. The TV ForecastYisim^s were mostly generic, listing only the series title; if program information was given, it was the star or a statement (for example, ""Scientific adventures in the world of the future""). TV Guide lists program notes for a number of Secret File episodes, although many state ""No program information available at press time."" It is possible, however, to determine that the Saturday shows were complete in one episode, not serialized adventures characteristic of the daily series. On March 28, 1955, the daily series came to an end. On July 10, 1955, the format changed again; it was now an hour-long series wherein Captain Video was the host to old theatrical serials and movies. On September 25, 1955, Captain Video was incorporated into Wonder Time, a six-hour series that ran from noon to 6:00 P.M. Sandy Becker served as the host and Al Hodge, as Captain Video, hosted a series of cartoons and documentaries. On August 16,  1957, Captain Video ended with the demise of the DuMont network. The series itself was set in the future (the 21st then  22nd centuries). Captain Video is a scientific genius who heads the Video Rangers, an organization that battles evil throughout the universe (only the best candidates at Video Ranger Training Academies are chosen to become Video Rangers). The Space Federation appears to be the governing force on Earth (orders are given by the Space Council). Commissioner Bell (then Carey) is its leader and the Federation is based on the I44th floor of the Public Safety Building in Planet City. Captain Video first pilots a rocket ship called the X'9, then the Galaxy and Galaxy //; the Video Ranger had his first command as captain of a ship called the Cormorant. Dr. Pauli, the Captain's enemy, is president of the Asteroidal Society and inventor of the Cloak of Invisibility. He ruled from the manmade metallicPlanet of Dr. Pauli (from which he plans to conquer the universe). Clipper Evans was another enemy of the Captain's who often sided with Dr. Pauli. Before he was able to control it for purposes of good, the evil robot Tobor was also a threat to the Captain (see Here Comes Tobor for a proposed series based on this character; Tobor is robot spelled backwards). Ranger Craig was a rookie who helped the Captain. The character was unusual in that it was played by a girl (Gerrienne Raphael) who was made up to look like a teenage boy. Early episodes that were broadcast live and contain scenes from old theatrical films. The stars of these films were called Video Rangers and the action scenes were said to be the adventures of other Video Rangers fighting elsewhere for justice (they were seen via Remote Carrier Delayed Circuit TV Screens). On episodes broadcast without a sponsor, viewers saw a ""Video Ranger Message,"" a public service announcement geared to children. Fred Scott, who later played Ranger Rogers, announced and narrated. Cast: Richard Coogan {Captain Video), Al Hodge {Captain Video; later), Don Hastings {Video Ranger), Jack Orsen {Commissioner Bell), Ben Lackland {Commissioner Carey), Bram Nossem {Dr. Pauli), Hal Conklin {Dr. Pauli), Stephen Elliott {Dr Pauli), Grant Sullivan {Clipper Evans), Jack Orsen {Commissioner Gary; 1949-1950), Ben Lackland {Commissioner Gary; 1950-1955), Dave Ballard {Tobor, the Robot), Nat Polen {Ranger Carter), Kenneth Nelson {Ranger Colt), Ernest Borgnine {Nargold}, Bob Hastings {Hal; Video Ranger's brother), Gerrianne Raphael {Ranger Craig), Dick Moore {Ranger Jejf Hillary) , Stefan Schnabel {Professor Linkoff), Laura Weber {Mara Linkoff), Tom McDermott {Permes Lykos), Fred Scott {Ranger Rogers), Dickie Moore {Ranger Hillary), Georganne Johnson {Princess Auora).

It was, however, a series of tragic events that transformed Texas Ranger John Reid into the Lone Ranger and teamed him with Tonto, the Potawatomi Indian who saved his life. It began with an assignment to capture Butch Cavendish, the head of the notorious Hole in theWall Gang. Butch, however, proved too clever for the Rangers to capture. At Bryant's Gap, a canyon about 50 yards wide and bound by cliffs, a team of six Texas Rangers are ambushed by the Cavendish gang and left for dead. Later that day Tonto, who had been hunting for food, finds a lone survivor of the attack _ John Reid. Tonto brings Reid to the shelter of a small cave and begins nursing him back to health. As Reid recovers, he recalls Tonto as the Indian he befriended as a child. Years ago, when Tonto was a child, his village was raided by renegade Indians. His parents were killed and Tonto was left for dead. A young John Reid found Tonto and helped him recover from his wounds. It was at this time that Tonto called Reid ""Kemo Sabe"" (translated as both ""Faithful Friend"" and ""Trusted Scout""). There is a small patch of grassland that lies amid the rocks broken by countless years of wind and storm. On that land are six graves, each marked by a crudely constructed cross to represent the Texas Rangers who were killed _ Captain Dan Reid (John's brother), Jim Bates, Jack Stacey, Joe Brent and Ben Cooper. The sixth cross bears the name of John Reid _ put there by Tonto to convince Cavendish that all the Rangers had been killed; to conceal the fact that one Texas Ranger had lived to avenge the others _ the Lone Ranger. To conceal his true identity, Reid fashions a mask from the black cloth of his brother's vest. At first, Reid and Tonto posed as outlaws to enable them to apprehend the Cavendish gang _ some of which were hanged, others imprisoned. Once their goal was accomplished, they became a force for good _ ""Wherever you find a wrong to be righted, that's where you'll find the Lone Ranger"" (Reid says also that ""keeping my identity a secret makes the pursuit of outlaws easier""). The Lone Ranger's trademark is the silver bullet _ a precious metal that reminds him to shoot sparingly and to remember the high cost of human life. The silver comes from a mine Reid inherited. Jim Blaine is the old miner who works the Ranger's silver mine. George Wilson is the Ranger's secret banker in Border City who exchanges the silver for money. Later episodes feature Dan Reid, John's nephew, as an assistant. The Lone Ranger rides a white horse named Silver (whom he calls ""Big Fella""). Scout is Tonto's horse; Victor is Dan's horse. Father Paul is Reid's friend, the padre at the San Brado Mission. As the show's theme, ""The William Tell Overture"" by Rossini plays, an announcer's voice is heard: ""A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! With his faithful Indian companion, Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early West. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear; the Lone Ranger rides again!""The program's closing is just as famous. While there were many variations, a typical sequence would begin with a man saying ""You know those two men saved my life and I didn't even get the Masked Man's name."" A sheriff would respond, ""A name's not important. It's what a man does that counts. No man has done more for the west than The Lone Ranger."" As the Ranger and Tonto ride into the sunset, ""Hiyo Silver"" is heard. The series is based on the radio program created by George W. Trendle. Cast: Clayton Moore (John Reid/Lone Ranger), John Hart {John Reid/Lone Ranger), Jay Silverheels {Tonto), Chuck Courtney {Dan Reid), David Leonard {Father Paul), Ralph Littlefield {Jim Blaine), Tris Coffin {Dan Reid; flashbacks), Glenn Strange {Butch Cavendish), Lyle Talbot {George Wilson), Ben Weldon {Various Outlaw Roles).

7541, Smilin' Ed's Gang. ,Series, Children," NBC, CBS,  ABC",,,1950,,,1955," ""Hi ya, kids,"" host Smilin' Ed McConnell would say. ""You better come running, it's old Smilin' Ed and his Buster Brown Show. Good old Buster Brown shoes are on the air out here in Hollywood for another good old Saturday hullabaloo."" Children of all ages were then led into a world where the unreal became real. The set resembled a clubhouse, and Ed began each show seated in a large easy chair. He opened a rather big book called Smilin Ed's Stories, and various filmed segments were shown (most often the serial-like adventures of ""Ghanga Rama, the Elephant Boy""; these tales, set in Bakore, India, told of Ghanga Rama and his friend, Charmer). Other segments were the antics of Midnight the Cat and Squeaky the Mouse (for example, Squeaky attempting to play ""Oh Susannah"" on his fiddle while Midnight accompanies him on a drum), Grandie the Talking Piano, the Buster Brown Jug Jingle (jingles sent in by viewers) and the most popular segment, Froggie the Gremlin, the mischievous, magical frog (a rubber toy that was eventually marketed). Standing next to a grandfather clock, Ed would say, ""Now Froggie, you better become visible. Plunk your magic twanger, Froggie"" (at which time Froggie would become visible and say ""Hi ya, kids, hi ya, hi ya, hi ya!""). After a brief conversation between Froggie and Smilin' Ed, the show's weekly guest star would come out (for example, Vito Scotti as Signor Pasta Fausuolo, the music teacher). Froggie would do his best to exasperate him to a point where he would just walk off the stage in disgust. Buster Brown appeared only in the commercial segments; his well-known catchphrase was ""That's my dog, Tige, he lives in a shoe. I'm Buster Brown, look for me in there too"" [referring to the label inside the shoe]). ""Well, kids, old Smilin' Ed and the gang will be on television again next week at this same time. So be sure to invite your little pals over to see it. Now don't forget church or Sunday school. Now once again, we leave the air with this little song: ""The happy gang of Buster Brown now leaves the air.... Watch for us Saturday when Buster Brown is on the air."" The series is based on the radio program of the same title. It was originally called The Buster Brown TV Show, with Smilin' Ed McConnell and the Buster Brown TV Gang, and is also known as ""Smilin' Ed McConnell and His Gang and Smilin Ed's Buster Brown Gang.

7650, Space Patrol. ,Series, Adventure, ABC,,,1950,,,1955," The Space Patrol is a 30th century organization that is responsible for the safety of the United Planets (Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Venus). The United Planets measure seven and one third billion miles in diameter. The Space Patrol is based on the manmade city of Terra and is not only responsible for protecting the United Planets from alien invaders, but keeping the space lanes safe for travel. Major ""Robbie"" Robertson is the Security Chief for the United Planets; Buzz Corry is the commander of the Space Patrol and its chief operative(tackling dangerous missions in the cause of universal freedom) . He is assisted by Cadet Happy, Tonga and Carol Carlisle. Buzz succeeded his brother, Kit Corry as the chief of the Space Patrol shortly after the series began. Buzz is fascinated by Carnacan history (a lost civilization of the planet Mars) and is quick to take action in any situation to save his shipmates. His first ship was the Battle Cruiser 100; this was replaced by the Terra IVznd finally the Terra V. Cadet Happy, the winner of the Corry Scholarship (set up by Buzz's family) is a recent graduate of the Space Patrol Academy and served as Buzz's co-pilot. He is easygoing, a bit inexperienced and always ready for a fight. His hobby is photography and ""holy smokin' rockets"" is his favorite saying (which he utters when something goes wrong). Tonga, a criminal before being reformed, is now a Space Patrol ally (she previously robbed passengers on sightseeing ships). She works as the assistant to the Security Chief (Major Robertson) and often joins Buzz and his associates on assignments (in some episodes Tonga is said to be the secretary to the Secretary of the United Planets). Carol is the daughter of the Security General of the United Planets. She is a brilliant scientist and inventor of the Agra-Ray, a device that brings plants to full maturity in a matter of hours; however, if used in reverse, the ray can turn cities into stone. Carol and Tonga, while supposed to be ""the weaker sex,"" were in no way depicted as such. While their uniforms were designed to show their legs for a bit of ""cheesecake,"" they were capable of defending themselves (but were most often depicted as ""girls in distress"" who needed rescuing by Buzz). Major Robertson was quick to act but often questioned his decisions and worried about the consequences of his actions. He also invented the formula for the Zeta Ray, a machine that cures any illness and halts the spread of infection. Prince Baccarratti, also known as the Black Falcon, is an evil alien, based in his castle on Planet X, who sought to rule the United Planets by destroying the Space Patrol. Mr. Proteus, the man of many faces, was also a threat to Buzz and his crew. Agent X and Major Sova were also enemies of the United Planets. Space Patrol premiered locally in Los Angeles on KECA-TV on March 13, 1950, as a 15-minute daily serial. This was followed by a 30-minute Saturday morning network series that ran from December 30, 1950 to February 26, 1955. Both were distributed to affiliated stations by kinescope. KECA dropped the daily shows from national distribution when the cost of film and shipping became excessive. The daily shows now aired only in Los Angeles while the Saturday morning shows were still being seen elsewhere (about a week later) by kinescope (making a copy of a live TV show by photographing it off a moni-tor). By late 1952, when the coaxial cable permitted coast-to-coast transmission, the live Saturday shows were no longer kinescoped; the daily series was dropped. Jack Narz is the announcer; the program opens with these words: ""High adventure in the wild, vast regions of space. Missions of daring in the name of interplanetary justice. Travel into the future with Buzz Corry, commander-in-chief of the Space Patrol."" Cast: Ed Kemmer {Buzz Corry), Lyn Osborn {Cadet Happy) , Nina Bara {Tonga), Virginia Hewitt {Carol Carlisle), Bela Kovacs {Prince Baccaratti), Marvin Miller {Mr. Proteus), Norman JoUey {Agent X), Jack McHugh {Major Sova), Ken Mayer {Major ""Robbie"" Robertson), Glenn Denning {Kit Corry), Paul Cavanaugh {Security General).

8422," Tom Corbett, Space Cadet. ",Series, Adventure," CBS, NBC, ABC, DuMont",,,1950,,,1955," It is the year 2350 and the planets Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Venus have been colonized. They are part of the Solar Alliance and protected by the Solar Guards, a celestial police force that is based at Space Academy, U.S.A., a training school for aspiring Solar Guards. Space Academy itself enlists men of high school and college age to train as Solar Guards. While not readily explained, women are not permitted to become Solar Guards. They can, however, train as Auxiliary Cadets to assist Solar Guards in times of emergency. Stories follow the adventures of Solar Guards Tom Corbett, Astro and Roger Manning. Major Ben Connell, called ""Blastoff"" by the cadets, is the roughest, toughest and meanest officer in the Solar Guards, while Dr. Joan Dale, is the kindest of instructors at Space Academy. Tom, Roger and Astro are assigned to training on the Polaris. While supposedly only a cadet, Tom appeared to be more of an academy official (he gave orders, charted flights and booked space maneuvers). He was strong and forceful and showed leadership quality. He was also quick thinking, assertive and popular with all those he worked with. Early episodes find Tom as the storyteller. He is seated in an official-looking office and welcomes viewers to relate an adventure he shared with Roger and Astro. A flashback-type of sequence is used and Tom returns at the end of the story to relate the moral and bid farewell with his famous ""So long for now and spaceman's luck to all of you."" Astro was the alien member of the team. He was born to Teron parents on the planet Venus (at a time when it was just being colonized) and is considered to be a Venusian by his colleagues. He is a naturalborn engineer and his job is to oversee the rocket motors on the power deck of the Polaris. Astro has a quick temper and frequently acts without thinking first. Roger is a wise guy, sarcastic and always causing trouble (especially with his habit of playing practical jokes). He often taunts Astro and causes endless rifts between them. While he did work on the radar bridge (near the nose of the Polaris) he also thoughthe was better than everyone else (boasting of his own accomplishments while downgrading those of his colleagues). Why Roger was not expelled is a mystery, but in time of dire need he became helpful (but in the end he would always give into temptation and belittle others). He was replaced in last season episodes by Cadet T.J. Thistle, a non-practical jokeplaying student who had a chip on his shoulder (he felt his short height prevented him from achieving success). Dr. Joan Dale was the only regular female presence at the academy. She was a professional and dedicated to teaching. Joan was not a femme fatale (a girl always in need of rescuing). She was beautiful, educated, intelligent and capable of defending herself. Joan was also a researcher and inventor. She created Tom's rocket-powered space suit as well as a new rocket fuel and the Hyper Drive (which allowed the Solar Guards' rocket cruisers to reach nearby stars). Joan was not all work. She had a human side and would worry about her superior, Captain Steve Strong and Tom's crew when they were off on dangerous missions. Commander Arkwright was the stern principal of Space Academy; Cadet Eric Rattison headed the crew of the Vega; Rex Marshall appeared as Lieutenant Saunders in commercials for the show's longtime sponsor, Kellogg's Cereals (it was also sponsored by Kraft Foods and Red Goose shoes). Announcer Jackson Beck opened early episodes with these words: ""Space Academy, U.S.A., in the world beyond tomorrow. Here the space cadets train for duty on distant planets. In roaring rockets they blast through the millions of miles from Earth to far flung stars and brave the dangers of cosmic frontiers, protecting the liberties of the planets, safeguarding the cause of universal peace in the conquest of space."" The series ran on CBS in 1950; ABC, 1951-1952; NBC, 1951; 1954-1955; and on DuMont, 19531954.

John is a vacuum cleaner salesman for Household Appliances; Blanche is the typical American housewife struggling to make ends meet on what little salary John brings home (to 123 Englewood Drive, Apartment 22). They have a cat named Nature Boy, an unnamed canary and goldfish, and one thing in common: they love to bicker about anything and everything. John is also a chronic snorer (it's so loud that the neighbors often call to complain). ""It's like sleeping with a one man band.... Now I know what it is like to sleep at Cape Canaveral,"" Blanche says. John's pride and joy seems to be the one bedroom slipper he has. Blanche and a friend bought a raffle ticket and won a pair of slippers. They split the prize and John wound up with the right slipper. John keeps the slipper under his pillow _ ""It's the only slipper I have and I have to protect it with my life."" Blanche gets ""dizzy spells every five minutes that last a half hour."" John doesn't hate Blanche's cooking, he just doesn't understand it. Possum broth, powdered frog legs, frog omelets, deviled pancakes and two-foot-long rhubarb pies are the norm. Because Blanche has little money to spend, she sometimes borrows from the money John saves for his life insurance payments (she tells the company to pay the premium ""by deducting the money they will pay her when John drops dead""). Clara GoUup is Blanche's married sister. She and her husband, Barney GoUup, live at 121 Englewood Drive. Barney is a gambler and hangs out at the United Nations Pool Hall. His door bell plays the trumpet song that sounds the start of a horse race. Dr. Hersey is ""the quack,"" as John calls him, who treats the various ""ills"" the Bickersons have. His biggest challenge is to cure John of his chronic snoring (he has prescribed two aspirins and a jigger of bourbon every night. John is six months behind on the aspirin and two years ahead on the bourbon). Lew Parker later teamed with Betty Kean and reprised ""The Bickersons"" via guest shots on various variety series.

He tries but the tenants complain about ""those two hoodlums you have living here."" Those ""hoodlums"" are Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, out of work actors who are struggling to survive on what jobs they can find (or more aptly put, what jobs Bud can find for Lou).Lou was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and mentioned that he helps support his sister and three nieces. Bud, who gets the hiccups when he's nervous, mentioned that he was a professional loafer (one who makes bread; not, as Lou believes, one who gets paid for doing nothing). Lou was also a Junior G-Man (a graduate of a through-the-mails detective school) and carried a toy cap pistol around with him for protection. ""We've got to raise some money"" is often said by Bud, as he and Lou are always behind in their seven dollar a week rent and finding work becomes a priority. (When they can't find work they sell what little valuables they have at Hock Shop Harry's.) Bud and Lou did have a number of jobs throughout the series run. These mostly one-day employment opportunities included being waiters at Brodie's Sea Food Restaurant; wallpaper hangers; pest exterminators; pet store owners; delivery boys for the Susquehanna Hat Company on Fluegel Street and soda jerks. When there is a situation that involves a friend (or stranger) who is in trouble, Bud always remarks ""Costello will get you out of this."" Bud and Lou also tried their hand at becoming cops by attending police rookie school. While the rules of the rooming house are quite strict (""no cooking cabbage in the apartment; no door slamming; no loud radio playing after 9:30; no pets; no babies"") Lou most often breaks the no-pet rule with Bingo the Chimp, a chimpanzee he adopted while working in the pet shop. Bingo dresses like Lou (trademark checkered jacket and gray hat). The six-year-old Bingo and Lou argue each night over who is going to take their bath first. Lou mentioned that Bingo's mother was working with a circus and his father was in the Belgian Congo. When Bud and Lou are out of town, Lou's girlfriend, Hillary Brooke, baby sits for Bingo. Hillary, a gorgeous blonde, held jobs in accordance with what the episode called for (for example, nurse, dental assistant, waitress, lawyer's office receptionist, owner of the B-Bar-B Ranch in Texas, and owner of a haunted castle at Goblins Knob, which she inherited from her Uncle Montague). When Hillary calls on Lou she brings him cream puffs. 3While Sidney Fields was primarily the landlord, he also played a number of relatives who were supposed tops in their fields (for example, Professor Melonhead, the judo expert; Lawyer Claude Melonhead; Judge Melonhead). Mike Kelly is the neighborhood police officer called ""Mike the Cop""; Stinky Davis is Lou's friend, a 30-year-old ""kid"" who loves to play games like football and hopscotch with Lou; Mr. Botchagalupe is the neighborhood's enterprising street vendor (seen selling fruit, vegetables, ice cream _ whatever the episode called for).

125, The Adventures of Superman. ,Series, Adventure, Syn.,,,1952,,,1957," As the theme music (written by Leon Klatzkin) plays, an announcer begins the program: ""Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" Voices are then heard: ""Look, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman."" The announcer returns: ""Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands. And who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fightsa never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American Way."" But who is Superman _ and where did he come from? The story begins many years ago on a distant planet called Krypton, which is inhabited by a race of super intelligent beings. Jor-El (Robert Rockwell) is a leading scientist who believes the planet is being drawn closer to its sun and destruction. When he is unable to convince the Council of Scientists of his beliefs, he begins developing a rocket ship to save his wife, Lara (Aline Towne) and their infant son, Kal-El, from the impending disaster. Jor-El, however, has only time to complete a small, experimental rocket before the planet is struck by earthquakes. He and Lara decide to save Kal-El. The baby is placed in the rocket and Jor-El programs it to land on Earth, a planet he knows is inhabited. Shortly after the rocket is launched. Krypton explodes and scatters billions of particles of Kryptonite, the only substance that will be able to harm Kal-El, into the universe. The rocket enters the Earth's atmosphere on April  10, 1926, and crash lands near the Jones farm in Smallville, Kansas. Eben and Sarah Kent (Tom Fadden, Dina Nolan), a childless farm couple, witness the landing. Eben risks his life to save the baby from the burning rocket. The baby, wrapped in red and blue blankets, is miraculously unharmed. The rocket explodes seconds later, destroying all evidence of its ever having been there. Realizing that no one would ever believe their fantastic story, Eben and Sarah decide to raise the baby as their own and name him Clark Kent. As young Clark (Stuart Randall) begins to grow, he develops amazing powers (X-ray vision, incredible strength, the ability to fly). In 1951, following Eben's death from a heart attack, Sarah urges Clark to use his great abilities to help mankind. Before Sarah moves in with her cousin, Louise, she makes Clark a costume from the blankets that were originally wrapped around him (how she managed to cut and sew the indestructible material was not explained). To keep his true identity a secret, he maintains the alias of mild-mannered Clark Kent and moves to Metropolis, where he becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a crusading newspaper. Clark lives in Apartment 5H of the Standish Arms Hotel. While it appeared that Sarah had made only one costume for Clark in the pilot (""Superman on Earth""), later episodes show that Clark has three Superman costumes in his secret closet (located behind a false wall in his regular closet). Lois Lane is the Daily Planet reporter always in distress. She was born in the small town of Cliftonby-the-Sea and now lives in Apartment 6A. She suspects that Clark is Superman but can't prove it (she believes that every time Clark disappears in an emergency to become Superman, he is a coward _ ""Looking for a hole to hide in, Clark?""). Jimmy Olsen was originally depicted as the paper's photographer, then a cub reporter. He has the middle name of Bartholomew and lives with his mother in an undisclosed location. Like Lois, he too faces perilous situations and must be rescued by Superman. Perry White is the editor of the Daily Planet. He was a top notch reporter, then the mayor of Metropolis before becoming editor. ""Great Caesar's Ghost"" is the expression Perry uses when he becomes upset or angry; and ""Don't Call Me Chief!"" is what he yells at Jimmy for constantly calling him ""Chief."" William ""Bill"" Henderson is the police inspector who is most helped by Superman. Professor Twiddle (Sterling HoUoway) and Professor J.J. Pepperwinkle (Phillips Tead) are slightly off-center scientists who complicate Clark's life with their wacky inventions. The series is based on the comic strip by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster.

Horatio Frisby, who attended Hyldeberg University, owns the store; and Katherine Frisby, Horatio's daughter, is Ernest's girlfriend. Ernest, who earns $15 a week, is a jack-of-alltrades. He accidentally discovered interplanetary television when he fooled around with a television set and contacted the inhabitants of Jupiter. The planet is 600 million miles from Earth, and the Jupiterians we see are puppets Johnny Jupiter, Major Domo (the head robot) and Reject, ""the factory rejected robot"" (all voiced by Gilbert Mack). Stories relate Ernest's misadventures as he seeks the Jupiterians' help in solving his earthly problems. When Ernest contacts Johnny, he turns several dials on a large television and says, ""Duckweather on Earth, calling the planet Jupiter."" Through some primitive but effective special effects, Jupiter comes into view. Ernest can see and speak to Johnny and vice versa. If Ernest requires extraordinary help, Johnny sends Reject the Robot to Earth. To accomplish this, Johnny touches the puppet Reject and says, ""Super Jelly Bean Power."" Reject is sent through space and appears to Ernest (the only one who can see him). During the trip from Jupiter to Earth, the puppet becomes life-sized (the actor playing the robot is not credited). Reject's favorite television show is ""The Robot Club"" ( Jupiterian television programs are all educational and instructive). On Jupiter, robots were built to service the humanoid inhabitants (for example, Johnny) and are excellent repairmen. Johnny calls Ernest ""Mr. Duckweather."" Reta Shaw (as Mrs. Clandish, a townsperson) and Florenz Ames (as Mr. Latham, Horatio's nemesis) were semi-regulars in this version of the series (ABC owned and operated stations; syndicated elsewhere). An earlier version aired on DuMont. Here Ernest P. Duckweather (Vaughn Taylor) is a television station janitor who dreams of becoming a producer. One night he sneaks into the control room and begins playing producer. While fiddling with the various controls, he accidentally discovers interplanetary television when he contacts the people of Jupiter (puppets Johnny Jupiter; Major Domo, ""the head robot""; Reject, ""the factory rejected robot""; and Johnny's pal, B-12). Due to limited available information, it is difficult to compare both versions.It appears that the DuMont version, which was broadcast live, had only two actors: Vaughn Taylor as Ernest and Gilbert Mack doubling as Ernest's boss at the television station and as the puppet voices. Stories revolved around Johnny and Ernest assessing the values of their respective planets (which differed greatly; what was commonplace on Earth was usually just the opposite on Jupiter). An announcer opens the show: ""Time now for M&amp;M's presentation of Johnny Jupiter. Once upon a time on the far off planet Jupiter lived two strange creatures (Johnny Jupiter, Major Domo). Strange in looks but with a wisdom far greater than our own. Each day they searched the universe for signs of intelligent life but alas they found none. Instead they settled for the planet Earth. Now on this planet lived a young inventor by the name of Ernest Duckweather. He invented a television set unlike any known before. For on this set he was able to tune in the planet Jupiter. The adventures of Johnny Jupiter are brought to you by M&amp;M's, the chocolate treat that's neat to eat."" Cast: Wright King {Ernest P. Duckweather), Vaughn Taylor {Horatio Frishee), Cliff Hall {Horatio Frisby; later), Patricia Peardon {Katherine Frisby), Gilbert Mack {Voice of Johnny Jupiter), Gilbert Mack {Voice of Reject the Robot).

2718, Flash Gordon. ,Series, Science Fiction, Syn.,,,1953,,,," The G.B.I. (Galactic Bureau of Investigation) is a 22nd century organization that protects the members of the United Planets from alien invaders. Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Neptune are mentioned members of the alliance, while planets such as Thor, Eben, Diana, Oden and Zerkes are its enemies. Eben is said to pose the biggest threat as it is closest to Earth and only negative gravity protects the Earth from Eben. Commander Paul Richards heads the G.B.I. Flash Gordon, the son of a famous scientist, is its chief operative. Dr.Alexis Zarkov is the agency's chief scientist (inventor of negative gravity) and Dale Arden is his assistant, a scientist almost as brilliant as he. While Dr. Zarkovand Dale always assist Flash on assignments. Dr. Zarkov is always the last one to know what is happening ""because my work at my mountain lab keeps me out of touch with what is going on."" Flash, who wears a T-shirt with a lightning bolt on the front, originally had a rocket ship called the Sky Flash. When it was destroyed in a battle, he had the Sky Flash II (Casey the parrot is its mascot). Although the series is based on the comic strip by Alex Raymond, it differs greatly from the 1936 theatrical serial Flash Gordon. As originally depicted in the film. Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) was the athletic son of Professor Gordon, a world renowned scientist. He had no special powers and belonged to no organization. Steve Holland (TV's Flash Gordon) was like Buster Crabbe, physically right for the role. Dale Arden (Jean Rogers) was beautiful and sexy; she was not a scientist and always in harm's way. Jean, as Dale, was incapable of defending herself and relied on Flash to save her. Irene Champlin (TV's Dale Arden) was not as pretty as Jean Rogers and immediately strikes one as being too old for the part. Irene had dark hair (not blonde like Jean) and differed in the fact that she could defend herself and would jump into harm's way to help someone (Flash and Dr. Zarkov often had to restrain her from getting herself killed). Unlike Jean Rogers, whose character meant dangerous rescue missions for Flash, Irene's Dale was a quick thinker and often saved the trio from perishing. Television's Dr. Zarkov (Joseph Nash) was thinner and younger than one would imagine for one who accomplished so much. In 1936, Dr. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) was somewhat older, a bit heavier and was said to have invented Earth's first rocket ship (which he. Flash and Dale used to travel to the planet Mongo to stop Ming the Merciless from destroying the Earth). The television series was filmed in West Berlin (on a rather cheap budget); Kurt Heuser composed the theme. Cast: Steve Holland {Flash Gordon), Irene Champlin {Dale Arden), Joseph Nash {Dr. Zarkov), Henry Beckman {Paul Richards) . "

Andy usually began each program with Andy's Story Time. Seated on stage in a large easy chair, he opened a rather big book called Andy's Stories. As he read a chapter, a filmed segment was shown.

5314, The Mickey Mouse Club. ,Series, Children, ABC,,,1955,,,1959," For an hour (later half an hour) each weekday afternoon, children of all ages were entertained by a group of talented children (called ""Mouseketeers"") who were members of the Mickey Mouse Club. There were no rules and there were no fees; the only requirement was to have fun _ to sit back, ""put on your Mouseke-ears"" and join the Mouseketeers in songs, dances and sketches. ""Who's the leader of the club that's made for you and me"" meant the start of the show and fun with club leader Mickey Mouse and his friends. While Mickey Mouse appeared in animated form to introduce each episode, it was Jimmie Dodd and co-host Roy Williams who actually conducted the club. The stage was the official Mouse Club House and the Mouseketeers were introduced in many ways via song. The sight of Mickey, seated at a piano meant it was Monday and ""Fun with Music Day."" Tuesday found Mickey in a tuxedo and preparing for ""Guest Star Day."" A flying carpet, carrying Mickey in a sorcerer's suit, meant Wednesday's ""Anything Can Happen Day."" Thursday's ""Circus Day"" found Mickey dressed as a ringmaster. And ""Talent Round Up Day"" was the Friday show, with Mickey outfitted in cowboy duds. ""Time to twist our Mouseke-dial to the right and left with a great big smile; this is the way we get tosee a mouse cartoon for you and me. Meeska, Mooseka, Mouseketeer, Mouse Cartoon Time is now here"" (a door to the Mickey Mouse Treasure Mine would then open and a Disney cartoon would be seen). ""From the far corners of the Earth; from across the Seven Seas, the stories of today for the leaders of tomorrow"" signaled the beginning of ""The Mickey Mouse Club Newsreel"" (reported by Hal Gibney). ""Fun with a Camera"" was a segment with photographer Earl Kyser teaching the Mouseketeers aspects of photography. A daily serial was also a part of the program. For information on the major serials that were presented, see the following titles: Annette, Corky and White Shadow, The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of the Applegate Treasure, The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of Ghost Farm, Spin and Marty, The Further Adventures of Spin and Marty and The New Adventures of Spin and Marty. Other segments included the animated Jiminy Cricket in safety segments for children, and ""Sooty and His Friend Harry Corbett"" (Harry is the straight man for his non-speaking hand puppet. Sooty, who plays songs on his electric organ). Jimmie Dodd, who played the Mouseguitar (especially made by the Mattel Toy Company), concluded each show with a Words of Wisdom segment. (For example, Jimmie, holding a rubber band, would say, ""You know, Mouseketeers, this rubber band is a lot like truth. You can twist it but it will always come back the way it was. It is strong, but you can stretch it. The more you stretch it, the thinner it gets. Finally you can't stretch it any further and it's so thin you can't hold it _ and that's the time it's going to snap back. And when it does, you're the one that's been hurt. The truth is just the same as it was. You haven't changed it; but by twisting and stretching it, you've hurt yourself."") ""Now it's time to say goodbye to all our company. M-I-C (see you real soon), K-E-Y (why? Because we like you). M-O-U-S-Eeeeee."" See also the following title and The New Mickey Mouse Club. Host: Jimmie Dodd. Co-Host: Roy Williams.

For many years, I was executive secretary to the late multibiUionaire, John Beresford Tipton. He was one of the very few men who ever earned, by the use of his phenomenal brain, a fortune that ran into the billions of dollars. Among my duties was the unique job of delivering one million dollars which Mr. Tipton frequently gave away tax free, to a total stranger."" Of the 2.5 billion people populating the world in  1955, only 19 were worth $500 million or more. One such man was John Beresford Tipton (never fully seen). Mr. Tipton lived a life of treasured seclusion and conducted his business activities from Silverstone, his 60,000 acre estate. Here, he indulged in many hobbies, the most unusual of which began when his doctor told him that he must find a means of relaxation. Mr. Tipton, seated in his study, is toying with one of his ivory chess figures, when he sends for his executive secretary, Michael Anthony. ""You sent for me, sir?"" ""You know, Mike,"" Tipton says, ""these chessmen were the first luxury I ever allowed myself ... I decided to make my hobby a chess game with human beings ...

John Beresford Tipton issued 188 checks for onemillion dollars (drawn on the Gotham City Trust and Savings Bank). His unique hobby was related to the subject of human nature. ""Every subject in his vast store of knowledge was close analysis and was always related to the behavior and destiny of man."" Each check recipient must sign a document agreeing never to reveal the exact nature of the gift or its amount. Spouses can be told, but telling anyone else results in a forfeiture of any remaining monies.

A ranch hand, cavalry scout, army undercover agent, deputy, trail boss and wagon train guide were but a handful of the jobs held by Cheyenne Bodie as he drifted across the American frontier of the 1860s. Cheyenne is a strong, quiet man who fights for the rights of others. He is proud of his heritage and is dedicated to helping the army build up the land and establish a peace treaty with his blood brothers (he can read smoke signals and is trusted by the Indian chiefs). He carries a hunting knife on the left side of his holster (his gun is on the right side) and is looking for a place to settle down and call home (he hopes one day to buy a ranch and raise horses). In the episode ""Legacy of the Lost,"" Sloane and Sloane detective Dennis Carter (William Windom) convinces Cheyenne that he is John Abbott, the long lost son of wealthy rancher Lionel Abbott (Peter Whitney). Cheyenne now has a younger brother, James Abbott (Peter Breck), and a sister-in-law, Lorna ( Jolene Brand); he is also heir to the vast Abbott wealth. (Cheyenne discovers that James hired Carter to find someone who could be John Abbott and then kill him so James could become the sole heir. By coincidence, Lionel's wife and infant son were on the same wagon train as the infant Cheyenne. Lionel believed that his son was taken by the Cheyenne and would one day return to claim what is rightfully his.) Note: L.Q. Jones as Smitty, a government mapmaker, was Cheyenne's sidekick during the 1955-56 season when Cheyenne alternated with Kings Row and Casablanca on Warner Bros. Presents. Cast: Clint Walker {Cheyenne Bodie). Theme Song: ""Cheyenne"" by Stan Jones and William Lava. "

Cody, the inventor of the Rocket Flying Suit, has come to be known as ""The Sky Marshal of the Universe"" for his tireless efforts of protecting the Earth from the evils of outer space. Cody, Joan, Ted (and Dick) communicate with each other via their identification patches, which contain miniature two-way radios and operate on a frequency assigned only to Commando Cody.

The pilot and two of the plane's three passengers are killed. The lone survivor, a young girl, is found by Logi, the noble chief of the Inoma tribe. Logi names the girl Sheena and raises her to respect good men and hate bad ones. The series begins when Sheena is 28 years old. She is blonde, five feet, nine inches tall and weighs 141 pounds. She measures 39-24-38 and wears a conservative but leg revealing leopard skin dress with a black waist belt that has a cloth attachment to hold her ivory horn (which she uses to summon the animals for help). Sheena also carries a spear and a knife. Sheena, called ""The White Jungle Goddess"" by superstitious natives, is assisted by her pet chimpanzee, Chim (played by Neil). Chim likes to fish and Sheena says that one day he is going to catch ""The Big One."" Sheena's friend. Bob Rayburn was originally depicted as a white trader and made Kenya his home (he bought supplies from the Evans Trading Post). As more unscrupulous characters invaded Africa, Rayburn was said to be a big game hunter who worked on behalf of the Commissioner to ensure the safety of people on safaris. He originally dressed in a black shirt and white pants and carried a knife and handgun; later, his dress is all white and he is armed with a rifle. Sheena prefers to ""move through the trees"" (swing by vine from one to another) rather than walking through the jungle (""Faster my way,"" she says). When Sheena leaves her horn behind it indicates to Bob that she is in trouble. Irish McCalla as Sheena is television's first female superhero. The character would not appear on television again for 44 years when Gena Lee Nolin be-came the jungle queen in a new series titled simply Sheena (see prior title). Anita Ekberg was originally cast (1955) to play Sheena but prior commitments forced her to back out by the time the very rare color pilot was shot (the series is in black and white). The program was filmed in Mexico (although set in Kenya, East Africa; an end credit reads ""Animal sequences filmed in Africa""). Irish McCalla originally performed her own stunts. When she injured an arm, her stunts (basically swinging on vines through the trees) were performed by Mexican acrobat Raul Gaona (a tall enough woman, apparently, could not be found). Stunt scenes with Gaona, dressed in a leopard skin and blonde wig, are shot from his back and at a sizeable distance (impossible to tell who it is). Irish's stunt sequences can be identified by the closeness of the action. Cast: Irish McCalla (Sheena), Christian Drake {Bob Ray burn), Lee Weaver (Logi). Theme Song: ""Sheena"" by Eli Brisken. "

Nick has tried, but can't stop Nora from doing what she likes doing. To protect her, Nick resumes his role as a private eye to not only watch out for Nora but to ultimately help her solve a crime. Nick uses the ""laundry list"" method to solve crimes; Nick relates the facts, Nora writes them down. When someone takes a shot at Nick, he falls down so as not to disappoint the shooter _ ""It also prevents them from taking another shot."" Nick calls Nora ""Tiger""; Nora calls Nick ""Nickie."" Nick has an eye for the ladies although he tells Nora, ""None are as beautiful as you."" Nora feels her intuition is better than Nick's experience when it comes to solving crimes. She also never thinks in emergencies _ ""I only have hunches.""Nick calls Asta their child because of the way Nora babies him. Even though the dog is a male, Nora gave him a girl's name based on her Uncle Harry's theory that a sissy name will make a man out of a boy. Beatrice Dean is a beautiful con artist who goes by the alias of Blondie Collins. ""Blondie has a knack for larceny,"" says Nick, who has arrested her on several occasions. She often serves time at the Elmsville Prison for Women. When Blondie is in trouble and needs refuge, she considers the Charleses' home a port of call and retreats to it for help and Nick's affections. Despite Nora's jealousy, Nick can't resist ""a gorgeous doll"" and always helps Blondie. Hazel is Nora's friend, an attractive single woman who has a crush on Nick and flirts with him at every opportunity. She lives in the brownstone next to Nick and Nora's. In second season episodes, Nick and Nora appear to live in a brownstone rather than an apartment as evidenced by outdoor scenes. Ralph Raine and Harry Evans are lieutenants with the Homicide Division of the N.Y.ED, who assist Nick and Nora in solving crimes. See also Nick and Nora.

He has been summoned by his father, Don Alejandro, to help fight a tyrant, the new comandante, Enrique Monasterio, who has imposed harsh laws and taxes on the people in his quest to become the richest man in California. In his cabin aboard ship, Don Diego tells his mute servant Bernardo that he must find a way to deal with Monasterio without arousing suspicion that his father has summoned him home. Bernardo uses sign language to suggest force _ ""No, Bernardo. I'm dealing with a powerful enemy. We must play another game."" Just then Don Diego recalls a proverb: ""When you cannot clothe yourself in the skin of a lion, put on that of a fox. I must convince the new comandante that I am perfectly harmless. Instead ofa man of action, I shall be a man of letters, an innocent scholar interested only in the arts and sciences."" With his plan half organized, Don Diego then devises his secret alias, the man who will fight Monasterio _ ""Zorro _ the Fox."" He then chooses a black mask and outfit to disguise his true identity. However, to make his plan work, he must also conceal his secret identity from his father. The de la Vegas are the most important family in southern California. Zorro's base is a secret cave below his hacienda in Monterey. Zorro rides a black horse named Tornado and his trademark is the carved sign of the Z. While Zorro is an expert marksman, Don Diego pretends to be inexperienced at fencing. To further cover his tracks as Zorro, Diego teaches Bernardo to play the guitar (to make it appear that Don Diego is in his room practicing when in reality he is out battling injustice as Zorro). Although Zorro helps people, he is considered a criminal by the authorities. Zorro, ""a friend of the people,"" is ""the defender of the oppressed"" and ""the champion of justice."" After battling Monasterio for several months, Zorro finds a new enemy when Enrique is found to be corrupt by the Viceroy (John Dehner) and arrested. Captain Arturo PoUidano, the new magistrate, replaces him and vows to bring the criminal Zorro to justice.

Also living with them is Peter Tong, Bentley's Chinese houseboy and Jasper, the family dog. Bentley is a graduate of Harvard Law School. He is a smooth and brilliant conversationalist and girls swoon as he always manages to say the right thing. His greatest challenge is remaining single (he is just not yet ready to settle down) especially when his married friends (who sometimes set him up with dates) think he should become one of them. Kelly is a very sweet and very obedient young lady. Bentley treats her like she was his own daughter and Kelly never takes advantage of the situation (she not only has the greatest respect for him, but she admires him). Kelly and her friends Ginger and Howard attend Beverly Hills High School and hang out at Bill's Malt Shop after school. Howard was Kelly's on-and-off boyfriend from  1957-1961.

5184, Maverick. ,Series, Western, ABC,,,1957,,,1962," Bret and Bart Maverick are brothers. They are gentlemen gamblers who roam the Old West in search of rich prey. They are also cowards at heart, but more often than not they find themselves helping people in trouble. They are unconventional, selfcentered and untrustworthy, and they possess a genius for conning the con man. Although they served with the Confederacy during the Civil War, they became Union soldiers when they were captured and figured it would be better to help the enemy than spend time in a Union prison camp. As ""Galvanized Yankees"" (as Bart puts it), they were assigned to keep the Indians under control out West. At this same time, it is mentioned that another Maverick, Cousin Beauregard (Beau), became a family disgrace when he was honored as a war hero. Beauregard (""Pappy"") Maverick, the head of the family, instilled in his sons his cowardice and conartist genius. When Pappy, as he is called, learned that his nephew. Beau, did something to bring honor to the Maverick name, he branded him ""the white sheep of the family"" and banished him to England. (Actually, Beau had been captured. While he was playing poker with a Union general, the Confederates attacked the camp. Just as the general lost a game and exclaimed, ""Son, I give up,"" Confederate troops entered the tent. Beau was credited with the capture.) To make up for this family disgrace, Beau spent five years tarnishing his ""good"" name and was actually brought on (1960-61) to replace James Garner (who left the series in 1960). The following year, and until 1962, another brother. Brent, appeared when Roger Moore left at the end of the 1961 season. It is against a Maverick's principles to drink alone, and they have one serious vice _ curiosity. The Mavericks are from Little Bent, Texas, and a sheriff is not their best friend. A Maverick is not fast on the draw (if there is a way to get out of a gunfight, they will find it). Bret promised his Pappy that on his thirty-eighth birthday he would find himself a wife and raise 12 Mavericks. Bart, who enjoys smoking cigars, often says, ""Sometimes it frightens me what I'll do for money."" Bret contends that he is a cautious man _ ""It's the other faults that bother me."" Bret calls Bart ""Brother Bart,"" and Beau has a horse named Gumlegs. Although Beauregard (""Pappy"") Maverick appeared only once (in the episode, ""Pappy""), his proverbs became an established part of the series. One of the Mavericks would exclaim, ""As my old Pappy would say,"" followed by the saying (forexample, ""No use crying over spilled milk, it could have been whiskey""). Pappy is a ladies' man and a gambler like his sons (but women call him ""an old coot"" and ""a lecherous old goat""). On screen. Pappy is credited as ""Pappy...?"" Jack Kelly also played Pappy's brother, Bentley Maverick, in ""Pappy."" Besides the Indians, the outlaws and the sheriff, another threat to Bret and Bart was Samantha (""Sam"") Crawford, a beautiful con artist who was just as cunning and clever as the Mavericks. A Northern girl at heart, Sam faked a Southern accent and used, besides her genius at the con, her feminine wiles to acquire easy money. Gentleman Jack Darby and Dandy Jim Buckley are gamblers who also sought easy money and easy prey. Theme: ""Maverick,"" by David Buttolph and Paul Francis Webster.

He has box seats at the opera house, enjoys fine food (he even has his own recipes) and has an eye for the ladies. He smokes expensive cigars (he carries a spare in his boot), collects chessmen (especially the knight) and is lucky at gambling. He also has one rule: never to go anyplace without his gun. Paladin, a right-handed gunman, carries a Colt .45 revolver (""The balance is excellent; the trigger responds to the pressure of one ounce. It was handcrafted to my specifications."" He rarely draws it, ""But when I do I aim to use it""). Paladin's work clothes are a black outfit with a chess knight (the Paladin) embossed on his black holster. He also wears a black hat and carries a small derringer under his gun belt. Paladin is a graduate of West Point, and his experiences with the Union army have given him a knowledge of war tactics that he uses to help people. He has a talent with a gun, a devotion to duty and relaxes in luxury at the hotel, genuinely enjoying life between assignments. (He reads the newspapers from various states and sometimes sends his calling card to people he thinks may need his help; his fee is $1,000). The theme from the unaired pilot version of Have Gun _ Will Travel exchims, ""There are campfire legends that the plainsmen spin, telling of the man with the gun, of the man called Paladin."" Little is known about Paladin. His legend began when an unnamed ex-army officer lost a large sum of money to a wealthy land baron (William Conrad) in a poker game.

The officer then adopts Smoke's black outfit and the symbol of the Paladin as his own. He calls himself Paladin and begins a policy of hiring out his guns and experience to those who are unable to protect themselves. (In this particular episode, ""Genesis,"" Richard Boone played three roles: the older and younger Paladin and Smoke.)

3756, How to Marry a Millionaire. ,Series, Comedy, Syn.,,,1958,,,1960," Penthouse G on the  22nd floor of the Tower Apartment House on Park Avenue in New York City is home to Michele ""Mike"" McCall, Loco Jones and Greta Hanson, three beautiful girls seeking millionaire husbands. The girls have taken a pledge (""On my honor I promise to do my best to help one of us marry a millionaire. So help me. Fort Knox""). Mike, Loco and Greta were each renting a small apartment on Amsterdam Avenue before Mike convinced them to pool their resources (""You gotta spend money to make money"") and rent a swank penthouse (""We have something to sell _ ourselves _ and we have to surround ourselves in the best possible surroundings""). While each seeks to help the other find a millionaire, virtually every cent they make goes toward paying the rent. When Mike spots a potential prospect, she sees dollar signs (as does the viewer _ when a moneybag is superimposed over the subject); her credo is ""Have money, will marry."" Mike, the schemer of the group, works as an analyst for the Wall Street firm of Hammersmith, Cavanaugh and Hammersmith. She believes that ""the only way for a girl to be smart is to be dumb."" Mike reads the financial section of the newspaper and uses Dunn and Bradstreet ioT her research material. She feels that ""one of these days we're gonna hit it big"" and knows that women have to put on airs _ ""Men go for either the sophisticated Tallulah [Bankhead] type or the slinky Marilyn Monroe type."" Greta is a hostess on the TV game show Go for Broke, a takeoff of The $64,000 Question. She reads Who's Who in America (her research material) and the drama and TV section of the newspaper. Greta borrows Mike and Loco's nylons, doesn't make her bed and enjoys soaking in a bubble bath. She hopes that if there is a millionaire out there for her that ""he comes along before he has to whisper sweet nothings in my ear trumpet."" Loco (her given name) was born in North Platte, Nebraska, on February 25. She was voted ""The one most likely to go further with less than anyone"" atNorth Platte High School. She is a bit naive when it comes to current events but has acquired encyclopedic knowledge of comic strips by reading Super Comics magazine. Loco is nearsighted and needs to wear eyeglasses but feels men will not find her attractive if she does. The resulting chaos often costs the girls a prospective husband (""Loco has cost us more millionaires than the 1929 stock crash"" says Greta). Loco, a fashion model for the Travis (later Talbot) Modeling Agency, is called ""a fabulous blonde with an hourglass figure."" While always fashionably dressed. Loco worries about short skirts that show her legs. At the start of the second season it is learned that Greta married and moved to California (""Greta wanted to marry an oil man,"" said Mike, ""but she married a man who owns a gas station""). Mike and Loco acquire new roommate Gwen Kirby when she responds to their Journal News newspaper ad. Gwen, born in Illinois, was a girl scout and had been working on a small magazine before coming to New York. She now works as an editor for Manhattan Magazine and is almost a clone of Greta: Marilyn Monroe figure, lover of bubble baths and a borrower (of Mike and Loco's nylons). In the original, unaired 1957 pilot, Greta Lindquist (Lori Nelson), Loco Jones (Charlotte Austin) and Mike Page (Doe Avedon) are the women seeking millionaire husbands (they share a 13th floor Manhattan penthouse apartment). Loco is a brunette (not a blonde) in this version but just as vain about wearing her glasses. She mentions that her real name is Rita Marlene Gloria Claudette Jones and that Loco is her nickname. She is a model but no agency name is given. Greta, a blonde who majored in psychology at college, is hostess on the TV game show The Dunlap Quiz Show. Mike is a stockbroker for the firm of Hammersmith, Cavanaugh and Hammersmith. Both versions are based on the feature film of the same title.

3947, The Invisible Man. ,Series, Adventure, Syn.,,,1958,,,1960," Peter Brady is a British scientist concerned with the problems of optical density (the refraction of light). He is stationed at the Castle Hill Research Lab in England. During a test, reactor number three springs a leak and sprays Peter with a gas. His body absorbs the gas and it renders him invisible. Brady, however, lacks the knowledge to become visible. (He wears facial bandages, sunglasses and gloves to be seen. In one episode, Peter mentions that his clothes will become invisible if they are made of animal fibers, such as wool.) Before Peter can do anything, he is put under lock and key by the Ministry (they fear panic will result if it is known an invisible man exists). Through the use of his invisibility, Peter escapes and retreats to the home of his sister, Diane Wilson. There he explains to Diane and her daughter, Sally, what has happened. He concludes with, ""It's quite simple. Take a jellyfish, put it in water and you can't see it. That's happened to me. My reflective index has been lowered to that of theirs."" The situation changes drastically when a rival experimenter learns what has happened and attempts to steal Brady's formula for invisibility. The Ministry reverses its decision about Peter and allows him to continue his research: to find the key to becoming visible again. In the meantime, Peter uses his great advantage of invisibility to assist the British government in its battle against crime. In laterepisodes, Peter's invisibility is known to the general public. The identity of the actor portraying the lead (Peter Brady) had been (and still is) a closely guarded secret. (The cast for each episode, including the regulars, is listed only during the end credits. While the lead is listed first, he is credited only as ""The Invisible Man""; the remainder of the cast follows, each with a character name.) It has been rumored that series producer Ralph Smart played Brady (Smart did the same anonymous casting for The Iron Mask; see entry), or that actor Tim Turner, who appeared in the episode ""Man in Disguise,"" was actually the un-credited actor behind the bandages. The actor's identity was concealed not only from the public, but also from the cast and crew. (The actor wore bandages on the set; his voice was dubbed in after the episodes were shot. In some episodes he sounds American; in others there is a slight British accent.). A dramatically different version of the H.G. Wells story was produced in early 1958 but was scrapped and never aired. In it, Peter Brady is conducting an experiment in optical density on a guinea pig (which disappears, then reappears) when a reactor begins leaking. Peter's system absorbs too much of the gas, and he is rendered invisible; his clothes, however, do not become invisible. Peter is free to leave the lab; in fact, it is known that Peter Brady has become invisible (as television and newspaper reporters constantly annoy him). In this version he lives with his widowed sister Jane Wilson (Lisa Daniely) and her daughter Sally (Deborah Watling). It is difficult to predict how this version of the series would have progressed, since there was only one episode. Based on the storyline (Brady using his invisibility to rescue Sally from kidnappers) it appeared that he would either become a detective and use his invisibility to help solve crimes; or would follow the aired format and work with the British government _ which would give him the greatest chance of discovering the formula for visibility. There is no real ending explaining what Brady would do next. Peter works for Sir Charles, the British cabinet minister. Sir Charles's superior is the prime minister. (Sir Charles and the prime minister did not appear in the unaired pilot version.) Theme: ""The Invisible Man Theme,"" by Sydney John Kay (both versions of the show). Cast: ? {The Invisible Man), Lisa Daniely {Diane Wilson), Deborah Watling {Sally Wilson), Ernest Clark {Sir Charles), Ewen MacDuflF {Sir Charles; later), Basil Dignam {Prime Minister) . "

Jeff and Stu have an eye for the ladies, and girls often tell Jeff ""You're too cute to be a snoop."" Jeff is more adept at physical heroics than Stu, whom he sometimes calls""The Professor"" for his intelligence and ability to speak several languages.

2106, Dobie Gillis. ,Series, Comedy, CBS,,,1959,,,1963," Dobie Gillis and his friend, Maynard G. Krebs, are teenagers who live in a mythical community called Central City. Dobie lives with his father, Herbert T. Gillis, and his mother, Winifrid (""Winnie"") Gillis, at 285 Norwood Street; Maynard lives with his parents at 1343 South Elm Street. At 285 Norwood one will also find the Gillis Grocery Store, which is run by Herbert, a hard working, always complaining businessman (he and the family live above the store). Herbert is a member of the Benevolent Order of the Bison Lodge and always claims he is 46 years old. He is known as a cheapskate and was voted the ""citizen most likely to hang onto his last dollar."" Dobie and Maynard first attend Central City High School, then S. Peter Pryor Junior College. Their favorite after school hangout is Charlie Wong's Ice Cream Parlor, and in 1961 they both served a hitch in the army (in some episodes they are in Company A; in others Company C and Company Q). In college Dobie was the second assistant editor of the school's newspaper, the Pryor Crier. Dobie is the girl chasing, all-American teenage boy; unfortunately, he ""picks girls with caviar tastes for his peanut butter wallet."" While schoolmate Zelda Gilroy has a never ending crush on him and has set her sights on marrying him, Dobie has eyes for beautiful girls who seem to cause him only misery. Dobie is most famous for his infatuation with thestunning Thalia Menninger, the girl who knows Dobie is dirt poor and the son of a cheap father, but who has high hopes of his making ""oodles and oodles of money"" _ not for her but for her family, ""a  60-year-old father with a kidney condition, a mother who isn't getting any younger, a sister who married a loafer and a brother who is becoming a public charge."" Dobie's rival for Thalia is Milton Armitage, the rich, spoiled schoolmate who nicknamed her ""Mouse"" for her inability to choose between him and Dobie. Although the Thalia character was dropped when Tuesday Weld left the series, a new beauty _ Linda Sue Faversham was brought on to tempt Dobie in  1961. Like Thalia, Linda Sue seeks only to marry money and has high hopes of turning Dobie into a success so they can marry and support her unemployable family. Following in Linda Sue's footsteps is her gorgeous sister, Amanda Jean who is being groomed by Linda Sue to marry money. Following in Dobie's footsteps is his younger, dirt poor cousin, Duncan Gillis, who fell for Amanda Jean and found, like Dobie, that girls like Linda Sue (and Amanda Jean) ""are not for poor slobs like us."" Maynard, a beatnik who loves to play the bongo drums, is also a fan of jazz and hangs out at RifiF Ryan's Music Store. He has a stuffed armadillo named Herman and claims that the G in his name stands for Walter. He also has the world's largest collection of tin foil. While the longest word that he can pronounce is delicatessen, Maynard's idea of great Americans include General MacArthur, Admiral Dewey and Captain Kangaroo. Maynard always responds with ""You rang?"" when his name is mentioned and panics when he hears the word ""work."" Zelda Gilroy, the girl who taught Dobie how to play the guitar, is very intelligent (one of the reasons why she thinks that Dobie is not attracted to her). She is pretty but not as attractive as the girls Dobie falls for; she is always there for Dobie when he is dumped by his latest heartthrob. Zelda is from a large family and has six sisters (played by Sherry Alberoni, Jeri Lou James, Larraine Gillespie, Judy Hackett, Marlene Willis and Anna Marie Nanassi). Chatsworth Osborne, Jr., is the rich and spoiled son of Clarissa Osborne and is a friend of Dobie and Maynard's.

It was an age of jazz music, speakeasies, rum running, bathtub gin, murder, reprisal and organized disorder. Everything was on sale _ from wood alcohol to immortal souls _ and down the street was a guy who would give a discount on either one. Those were the accents of 1927 and the music, it was jazz. From the start it had kind of an epileptic charm. It fitted the times but it was more than the times. It said more, it made jokes and it wept. It laughed out loud, it dosed and sometimes spoke with regret."" For Pete Kelly, it began in Chicago. As a kid he became fascinated with the cornet and set his goal on becoming a musician.

The hours are bad, but the music suits us. There's one other thing about 17 Cherry Street and that's trouble. You can get it by the yard, the pound, wholesale and retail."" George Lupo owns the speakeasy. ""He was theonly kid in Linback County who got turned down for reform school,"" says Pete. ""He later fought in the war with the 102nd Infantry and he pays scale _ with a five dollar kickback.""
