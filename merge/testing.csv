(he wears facial bandages, sunglasses and gloves to be seen. in one episode, peter mentions that his clothes will become invisible if they are made of animal fibers, such as wool.) before peter can do anything, he is put under lock and key by the ministry (they fear panic will result if it is known an invisible man exists). through the use of his invisibility, peter escapes and retreats to the home of his sister, diane wilson. there he explains to diane and her daughter, sally, what has happened. he concludes with, ""it's quite simple. take a jellyfish, put it in water and you can't see it. that's happened to me. my reflective index has been lowered to that of theirs."" the situation changes drastically when a rival experimenter learns what has happened and attempts to steal brady's formula for invisibility. the ministry reverses its decision about peter and allows him to continue his research: to find the key to becoming visible again. in the meantime, peter uses his great advantage of invisibility to assist the british government in its battle against crime. in laterepisodes, peter's invisibility is known to the general public. the identity of the actor portraying the lead (peter brady) had been (and still is) a closely guarded secret. (the cast for each episode, including the regulars, is listed only during the end credits. while the lead is listed first, he is credited only as ""the invisible man""; the remainder of the cast follows, each with a character name.) it has been rumored that series producer ralph smart played brady (smart did the same anonymous casting for the iron mask; see entry), or that actor tim turner, who appeared in the episode ""man in disguise,"" was actually the un-credited actor behind the bandages. the actor's identity was concealed not only from the public, but also from the cast and crew. (the actor wore bandages on the set; his voice was dubbed in after the episodes were shot. in some episodes he sounds american; in others there is a slight british accent.). a dramatically different version of the h.g. wells story was produced in early 1958 but was scrapped and never aired. in it, peter brady is conducting an experiment in optical density on a guinea pig (which disappears, then reappears) when a reactor begins leaking. peter's system absorbs too much of the gas, and he is rendered invisible; his clothes, however, do not become invisible. peter is free to leave the lab; in fact, it is known that peter brady has become invisible (as television and newspaper reporters constantly annoy him). in this version he lives with his widowed sister jane wilson (lisa daniely) and her daughter sally (deborah watling). it is difficult to predict how this version of the series would have progressed, since there was only one episode. based on the storyline (brady using his invisibility to rescue sally from kidnappers) it appeared that he would either become a detective and use his invisibility to help solve crimes; or would follow the aired format and work with the british government _̨̻ which would give him the greatest chance of discovering the formula for visibility. there is no real ending explaining what brady would do next. peter works for sir charles, the british cabinet minister. sir charles's superior is the prime minister.

press release information is very scarce; and the pre-national tv guide, tv forecast, is extremely sketchy. it is difficult to determine when in 1949 the new captain video format emerged and when the words ""and his video rangers"" were added to the title. at this time, and until 1951, jack orsen played the captain's superior, commissioner bell. in 1951 (and until 1957) al hodge took over the role of captain video (from richard coogan); ben lackland became commission carey, the captain's new superior, from 1951 until 1955. the evil dr. pauli also became a regular at this time. hoping to cash in on the show's popularity, dumont added a saturday morning version of the series called the secret files of captain video (9/5/53-5/29/54). although that original dumont station is still broadcasting in new york (now wnyw) it has no records of its time as a dumont station. the tv forecastyisim^s were mostly generic, listing only the series title; if program information was given, it was the star or a statement (for example, ""scientific adventures in the world of the future""). tv guide lists program notes for a number of secret file episodes, although many state ""no program information available at press time."" it is possible, however, to determine that the saturday shows were complete in one episode, not serialized adventures characteristic of the daily series. on march 28, 1955, the daily series came to an end. on july 10, 1955, the format changed again; it was now an hour-long series wherein captain video was the host to old theatrical serials and movies. on september 25, 1955, captain video was incorporated into wonder time, a six-hour series that ran from noon to 6:00 p.m. sandy becker served as the host and al hodge, as captain video, hosted a series of cartoons and documentaries. on august 16,  1957, captain video ended with the demise of the dumont network. the series itself was set in the future (the 21st then  22nd centuries). captain video is a scientific genius who heads the video rangers, an organization that battles evil throughout the universe (only the best candidates at video ranger training academies are chosen to become video rangers). the space federation appears to be the governing force on earth (orders are given by the space council). commissioner bell (then carey) is its leader and the federation is based on the i44th floor of the public safety building in planet city. captain video first pilots a rocket ship called the x'9, then the galaxy and galaxy //; the video ranger had his first command as captain of a ship called the cormorant. dr. pauli, the captain's enemy, is president of the asteroidal society and inventor of the cloak of invisibility. he ruled from the manmade metallicplanet of dr. pauli (from which he plans to conquer the universe). clipper evans was another enemy of the captain's who often sided with dr. pauli. before he was able to control it for purposes of good, the evil robot tobor was also a threat to the captain (see here comes tobor for a proposed series based on this character; tobor is robot spelled backwards). ranger craig was a rookie who helped the captain. the character was unusual in that it was played by a girl (gerrienne raphael) who was made up to look like a teenage boy. early episodes that were broadcast live and contain scenes from old theatrical films. the stars of these films were called video rangers and the action scenes were said to be the adventures of other video rangers fighting elsewhere for justice (they were seen via remote carrier delayed circuit tv screens). on episodes broadcast without a sponsor, viewers saw a ""video ranger message,"" a public service announcement geared to children. fred scott, who later played ranger rogers, announced and narrated. cast: richard coogan {captain video), al hodge {captain video;
